# Architecture

The AI Autonomous AIR project is a highly scalable and secure system that enables dominant tactical autonomy for multi-ship, beyond visual range air combat missions. The project consists of several components, including:

## Frontend

The frontend of the project is built using React Native, which provides a native user experience on both Android and iOS platforms. The frontend communicates with the backend via REST API calls.

## Backend

The backend of the project is built using Node.js and provides a REST API for the frontend to communicate with. The backend also communicates with the blockchain network and edge devices to ensure that all the necessary data is available to the frontend.

## Blockchain

The project uses a blockchain network to store and manage data that is critical to the operation of the system. This network provides a secure and immutable ledger of all the data, ensuring that no data is lost or altered without proper authorization.

## Microservices

The project consists of two microservices, the Edge Service and the Cloud Service, that run on the backend. The Edge Service communicates with edge devices, such as drones, and the Cloud Service communicates with the blockchain network.

## Web GUI

The project includes a web GUI, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, that provides a graphical interface for the users to interact with the system. The web GUI communicates with the backend via REST API calls.

## Kubernetes

The project is deployed on a Kubernetes cluster and uses Kubernetes to manage the deployment, scaling, and orchestration of the components. Kubernetes also provides a platform for monitoring and logging of the system.

## Helm Chart

The project uses a Helm chart to define and manage the deployment of the components to the Kubernetes cluster. The chart includes templates for deployments, services, and ingresses.

## Infrastructure

The project uses Terraform for infrastructure as code and Ansible for configuration management. The CI/CD pipeline is implemented using Travis CI, Jenkins, and Jenkinsfiles.

## Conclusion

The AI Autonomous AIR project uses a combination of cutting-edge technologies to deliver a highly scalable and secure system for dominant tactical autonomy for multi-ship, beyond visual range air combat missions. The architecture is designed to be flexible, scalable, and secure, ensuring that the system can be quickly and easily adapted to meet the changing needs of the air combat missions.
